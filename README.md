Dataset summary: 
This dataset has been designed to enable a national picture to be built of the operation of storm overflows in the UK. This dataset will provide the status of Event Duration Monitoring equipment used to detect storm overflow discharges within one hour of the monitor indicating a discharge start or stop. It will also provide information about the location of indicated discharges, recent discharges and receiving watercourses.You can find further information about this data and what it represents on Stream’s detailed data pageWessex Water’s data is refreshed at intervals of 5 minutes.The following verification steps are performed on this data:Ad-hoc manual verification of discharge data is undertaken by Wessex Water staff to confirm if a discharge is valid. In some cases this may result in a discharge being removed from the feed if it has been found to be an error. Automated processes for flatline and spike detection are due to be implemented by the end of 2024.Wessex Water Storm Overflow Activity © 2024 by Wessex Water is licensed under CC BY 4.0
